    Plots a bar chart of average team attendance grouped by a time measurement of the user's choice.

    This function automatically loads and processes attendance data when called. The generated bar plot is a
        reflection of the user's desired time measure (by), team(s), year(s), and attendance measure. The user can
        also choose to add a 'league average' marker.
    Parameters:
        by (str): Time measurement to group by. Select one of the following:
                - 'start time': Game start time (Day/Night)
                - 'weekday': Day of the week
                - 'month' (default): Month (March/April, September/October are grouped together)
                - 'year': A year between 2012-2019.
        team (str): Team's abbreviation. Print team_abb_dict to see a list of team abbreviations. If no team is
                        selected, 'BOS' is the default.
        year (int): A year between the range 2012-2019. If None, all years are plotted.
        show_league_avg (bool): If True, a red marker indicates league average attendance numbers. Defaults to False.
        attendance (str): Determines whether attendance is measured as a raw number or as a percentage of the team's
                            stadium's capacity. Select one of the following:
                            - 'raw': Total attendance
                            - '%': Attendance as a percentage of stadium capacity (Default)
